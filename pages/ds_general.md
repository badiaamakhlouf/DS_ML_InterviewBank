### Q2- What is data science life cycle? 
The data science life cycle is a systematic and iterative process that data scientists follow to extract meaningful insights from data and solve real-world problems. It typically includes the following key stages:

1. Problem Definition : Objective and scope definition 
2. Data Collection :  identify data sources + data extraction 
3. Data Cleaning and Preparation : cleaning + transformation (NaN +Categorical)
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) : statistical analysis + visual exploration
5. Feature Engineering : variable selection +transformation (log, normalization)
6. Modeling : model selection + training + validation 
7. Evaluation : model evaluation + iterative improvement 
8. Deployment : integration + monitoring 
9. Communication : results interpretation + documentation
10. Feedback and Iteration : feedback incorporation + iterative refinement

This life cycle is not strictly linear and often involves iteration and refinement at various stages. Data scientists may go back and forth between stages based on insights gained, challenges encountered, or evolving project requirements.
