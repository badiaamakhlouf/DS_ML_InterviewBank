- Data science is the art of uncovering the insights and trends that are hiding behind data.
- Data Science involves data and some science. The definition or the name came up in the 80s and 90s when some professors were looking into the statistics curriculum, and they thought it would be better to call it data science.
- Data Science is the Science of working with data, to find answers coming from different departments such as sales, marketing, customer success etc. It's more about data than it is about science.
- Nowadays, data is the new oil of the digital economy as we have tons of data available coming from various sources: 
    - Data is structured, unstructured and semi-structured
    - Sources: log files, email, social media, sales data, patient information files, sports performance data, sensor data, security cameras, and many more besides.
- Data science becomes too available as cloud services are less expensive.
- Cloud provides such as AWS, GCP and Azure help provide the computing power needed to make a useful analysis and reveal new knowledge.
- Data science can help organizations understand their environments, analyze existing problems, and improve their business returns.

### Q1- How to define a good Data Scientis ?

- Data scientists leverage data analysis to enhance organizational knowledge by delving into data, exploring its potential to add value to the business.
- Effective data scientists exhibit curiosity, continuously asking pertinent questions and seeking answers through data exploration. They identify the necessary data and its sources, utilizing various analytical methods and models to uncover patterns and anomalies.
- Data scientists' findings may either confirm existing suspicions or unveil entirely new insights, guiding the organization's approach.
- Communicating these insights effectively requires strong storytelling skills, utilizing visualization tools to present findings and recommended actions to project stakeholders.
- A successful data scientist embodies curiosity, critical thinking, and adaptability. They must question assumptions, analyze data, and refine hypotheses to navigate from uncertainty to clarity effectively.

### Q2- What is data science life cycle? 
The data science life cycle is a systematic and iterative process that data scientists follow to extract meaningful insights from data and solve real-world problems. It typically includes the following key stages:

1. Problem Definition : Objective and scope definition 
2. Data Collection :  identify data sources + data extraction 
3. Data Cleaning and Preparation : cleaning + transformation (NaN +Categorical)
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) : statistical analysis + visual exploration
5. Feature Engineering : variable selection +transformation (log, normalization)
6. Modeling : model selection + training + validation 
7. Evaluation : model evaluation + iterative improvement 
8. Deployment : integration + monitoring 
9. Communication : results interpretation + documentation
10. Feedback and Iteration : feedback incorporation + iterative refinement

This life cycle is not strictly linear and often involves iteration and refinement at various stages. Data scientists may go back and forth between stages based on insights gained, challenges encountered, or evolving project requirements.
