## List of Questions:

### Q1- What are the types of Data Analytics
- Data analytics can be broadly categorized into four main types: descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analytics.
- Each type serves a distinct purpose and provides different insights into the data.
- Hereâ€™s an overview of each type:
    - Descriptive Analytics: understands and summarizes past data
    - Diagnostic Analytics: explains why events happened.
    - Predictive Analytics: forecasts future events and trends.
    - Prescriptive Analytics: recommends actions to achieve desired outcomes.
- These types of data analytics build upon each other, starting with understanding what happened (descriptive), why it happened (diagnostic), what might happen (predictive), and what actions to take (prescriptive)
- Together, they provide a comprehensive approach to data-driven decision-making.

### Q5- What does Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) mean? 

- It is a critical step in the data analysis process and is often the second step after cleaning the provided dataset.
- It aims to summarize the main characteristics of a dataset, gain insights into the underlying structure, identify patterns, detect anomalies, and formulate hypotheses for further analysis.
- Effective EDA helps to perform more targeted and informed analyses, leading to better decision-making and valuable insights from the data.
- **Key aspects of Exploratory Data Analysis include:**
     - Summary Statistics using `.describe()` pandas library.
     - Data Visualization
     - Distribution Analysis
     - Correlation Analysis
 
### Q6- How to get statistical description of our data using pandas ? 

- In the statistical description we try to select the next values for each numerical features:
    - Maximum values
    - Minimum
    - Average
    - Standard deviation
    - Median
    - Mean
- Code: `df.describe().transpose()`
- Example:

### Q7- What does Distribution Analysis mean?

- This analysis aims to examine the distribution of values within a dataset.
- Understanding the distribution of data is essential for gaining insights into its underlying characteristics, identifying patterns, and making informed decisions about subsequent analyses or modeling.
- Here are some examples of distribution analysis: 
    - Frequency Distribution:  it provides a summary of how often each value appears. 
    - Univariate and Bivariate Analysis : distplot, histplot and X versus Y etc.
    - Probability Distribution
    - Spread or Dispersion analysis
    - Skewness and Kurtosis analysis
    
- Understanding the data distribution is very important in many tasks, including identifying outliers, assessing the appropriateness of statistical models, and making decisions about data transformations.
- Different types of distributions may require different approaches in data analysis and modeling, and distribution analysis helps inform these decisions.

### Q8- What does Skewness mean?

- It is a measure of the asymmetry of a distribution.
- A distribution is asymmetrical when its left and right side are not mirror images.
- A skewed data can not be used to generate normal distribution. 
- It provides insights into the shape of a distribution.
- The three types of skewness are:
    - **Skewness > 0 :** right (or positive) skewness. This indicates that the tail on the right side is longer or fatter than the left side, and the majority of the data points are concentrated on the left side.
    - **Skewness < 0 :** left (or negative) skewness. It means the tail on the left side is longer or fatter than the right side, and the majority of the data points are concentrated on the right side.
    - **Skewness=0, Zero skewness :** the distribution is perfectly symmetrical.
    
<img src="images/Skewness.png" width="500">

_Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness_


- If we have a positively skewed distribution:  Mode < Median < Mean 
- If we have a left-skewed distribution: Mean < Median < Mode 

### Q9- What does Kurtosis mean ?  

- A statistical measure that describes the shape or "tailedness" of a distribution. 
- It provides information about the concentration of data points in the tails relative to the center of the distribution:
   - The data can be heavy-tailed means it has more extreme values than a normal distribution.
   - Or it can be light-tailed means it has fewer extreme values than a normal distribution.
- The three types of Kurtosis are:
    - **Kurtosis=0 (Mesokurtic) :** the distribution has the same tail behavior as a normal distribution.
    - **Kurtosis>0 (Leptokurtic):** the distribution has fatter tails (heavier tails) and a sharper peak than a normal distribution. This indicates a higher probability of extreme values.
    - **Kurtosis<0 (Platykurtic):** the distribution has thinner tails (lighter tails) and a flatter peak than a normal distribution. This suggests a lower probability of extreme values.

### Q10- What does Spread or Dispersion analysis mean ?

- Spread analysis and dispersion analysis are usually used interchangeably, but they can have subtle differences depending on the context.
- Dispersion analysis is a more specific term used in statistics to describe the variability within a dataset.
- Spread analysis might be used more broadly depending on the context, particularly outside of pure statistical analysis.
- **Dispersion analysis:**
    - It explains how individual data points in a dataset deviate or spread out from a central measure of tendency, such as the mean or median. 
    - Dispersion measures provide insights into the variability or spread of the data and are crucial for understanding the overall distribution.
    -  Common measures of dispersion include:
       - Range: The difference between the maximum and minimum values.
       - Interquartile Range (IQR): The range of the middle 50% of the data, calculated as the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles.
       - Variance: The average squared deviation from the mean, showing how data points are spread out.
       - Standard Deviation: The square root of the variance, providing a measure of spread in the same units as the data.
       - etc.

- **Spread analysis:** 
    - It might not only focus on statistical measures of dispersion but also consider how the spread affects decision-making, risk assessment, or comparison between different datasets.
    - It is used in various area such as finance, economics, and marketing to refer to differences between values (e.g., bid-ask spread, yield spread) beyond just statistical dispersion.
    - It can include the Dispersion analysis measures but may also consider broader implications and specific contexts.

### Q11- What does Correlation Analysis mean?

- Correlation analysis is a statistical method used to evaluate the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two quantitative variables.
- The result of a correlation analysis is a correlation coefficient, which quantifies the degree to which changes in one variable correspond to changes in another.
- The most common correlation coefficient is Pearson's r, which ranges from -1 to 1:
   - +1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship.
   - -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship.
   - 0 indicates no linear relationship.
- Correlation analysis include three cases:
   - **Positive Correlation:** indicates that when one variable increases, the other increases.
   - **Negative Correlation:** indicates when one variable increases, the other decreases.
   - **No Correlation:** it indicates when there is no apparent relationship between the variables. 
- Correlation analysis is widely used in various fields, including economics, biology, psychology, and data science, to understand relationships between variables and make predictions based on observed patterns.
- Both correlation matrix heatmap and Scatter Plots are used to illustrate correlation analysis.

### Q12- What is the Scatter Plot ?

- It is a graphical representation of the relationship between two variables, X versus Y.
- Each point on the scatter plot represents an observation. Patterns in the scatter plot can indicate the type and strength of the correlation.
- It is typically used for visualizing and analyzing the relationship between two quantitative (numerical) variables.
- It is mainly used for trend identification, correlation analysis and outliers detection
- Scatter plots are a fundamental tool in exploratory data analysis (EDA) for uncovering relationships between variables and guiding further statistical analysis and modeling.

### Q13- What does correlation matrix mean? 

- It is a table that displays the correlation coefficients between many variables. 
- Each cell Corresponds to the correlation coefficient between two variables. 
- This matrix helps detect the presence of any positive or negative correlation between variables.
- The correlation is calculated using the pearson correlation coefficient so values varies from -1 to 1
- It is often visualized using heatmaps, where colors represent the magnitude and direction of correlations. This can make it easier to identify strong and weak correlations at a glance.

### Q14- Why removing highly correlated features is very important?
- Removing highly correlated features is a preprocessing step and it is important for several reasons, especially in the context of statistical modeling and machine learning.
- It can be beneficial for both classification and regression tasks.
- Here are the key reasons why this is crucial:
   - Highly correlated features make it difficult to determine the individual effect of each feature on the target variable.
   - Besides, highly correlated features can introduce redundancy into the model, leading to overfitting and reduced generalization performance.
   - Removing them simplifies the model, makes it easier to interpret and improve its generalization to new data.
   - Reducing the number of features by removing highly correlated ones can lead to faster training times and reduced computational resource requirements via focusing on the most informative and relevant features.
  
### Q15- What does Normal distribution mean ?
- It is also known as the Gaussian distribution and it is a continuous probability distribution that is symmetric about its mean.
- It describes how the values of a variable are distributed.
- It is very useful in machine learning because it has deterministic statistical characteristics and it helps detect linear relationship between variables.
- Here are the key characteristics and properties of the normal distribution:
   - It has a Bell-shaped and symmetric curve about the mean.
   - The mean, median, and mode of the distribution are all equal.
   - The tails of the normal distribution approach, but never touch, the horizontal axis (x-axis)
   - The normal distribution has a single peak (one mode)
   - Empirical Rule:
      - 68% within 1Ïƒ of the mean.
      - 95% within 2Ïƒ of the mean.
      - 99.7% within 3Ïƒ of the mean

        - Applications: Spam detection (spam or not spam), image recognition (cat, dog, or other), medical diagnosis (disease present or not), etc.


### Q22- What information could you gain from a box-plot?
- It is also known as a box-and-whisker plot.
- It is a valuable tool in exploratory data analysis for quickly summarizing the distribution, central tendency, variability, and presence of outliers in a datase.
- It provides insights into the shape and characteristics of the data that can aid in understanding its underlying patterns and making informed decisions in statistical analysis.
- It provides several key pieces of information about a dataset:
    - **Median:** the line inside the box represents the median (50th percentile) of the data, showing the central tendency.
    - **Spread:** the length of the box (interquartile range, IQR) indicates the spread of the middle 50% of the data. The longer the box, the greater the variability in the data.
    - **Outliers:** points beyond the whiskers indicate potential unusual data points or outliers.
    - **Symmetry:** it provides a visual indication of symmetry or asymmetry in the data distribution. A symmetrical distribution will have a box plot where the median divides the box equally, and the whiskers are of equal length on both sides. Asymmetrical distributions will have medians that do not divide the box equally and uneven whisker lengths..
    - **Comparison:** it allows for easy comparison between different groups or categories within the dataset via using multiple box plots side by side to compare the distributions of different groups.
    - **Skewness:** the position of the median within the box can give an indication of skewness. If the median is closer to the lower quartile (bottom of the box), the data may be negatively skewed (left-skewed); if closer to the upper quartile (top of the box), the data may be positively skewed (right-skewed)

- Box-plots are versatile tools for exploring and comparing **numerical data** distributions across different conditions or groups.
- They provide a clear, visual summary that aids in understanding key aspects of the data's distribution and variability.
- They are particularly useful for:
   - **Comparing Groups**
   - **Identifying Skewness and Outliers**
   - **Visualizing Spread and Variability**
   - **Summarizing Central Tendency**
   - **Handling Large Datasets**

### Q24- What is Violin Plot and what is used for?

- It is a graph that combines aspects of a box plot and a density plot.
- It is used for visualizing and comparing data distributions, providing insights into how data is spread across different groups.
- The width of each "violin" represents the density of data points at that value.
- **Uses of Violin Plots:**
   - **Comparing Distributions:** they are used to compare data distributions between different categories or groups.
   - **Data Shape:** they show the shape of the distribution, including skewness and multimodal patterns.
   - **Outlier Detection:** they help in identifying outliers within each category.
