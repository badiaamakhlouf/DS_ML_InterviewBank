### Q- What is the difference between covariance and correlation?

- These two measures are used during the exploratory data analysis to gain insights from the data.
- **Covariance:** 
   - It measures the degree to which two variables change together.
   - It indicates the direction of the linear relationship between the variables.
   - It can take on any value

- **Correlation:**
   - It is a standardized measure of the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables.
   - It ranges from -1 to 1, where :
        - 1: perfect positive linear relationship.
        - -1: indicates a perfect negative linear relationship.
        - 0: indicates no linear relationship.
