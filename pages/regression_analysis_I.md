## List of questions:
### Q0- What does regression analysis mean?
- It is a statistical technique used in data science and machine learning fields. 
- It aims to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
- By modeling the relationship between inputs and output, it is easy to understand the nature and strength of the relationship and to make predictions based on that understanding.
- Mainly, we use regression analysis to resolve problems and answer questions such as:
    - How does a change in one variable (independent variable) impact another variable (dependent variable)?
    - Can we predict the value of the dependent variable based on the values of one or more independent variables?
- It is widely used in various fields, including economics, finance, biology, psychology, and machine learning.

### Q1- Examples of well-known machine learning algorithms used to solve regression problems
Here are some well-known machine learning algorithms commonly used to solve regression problems:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Bayesian Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting Algorithms (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
- Neural Networks (Deep Learning)
  
### Q2- What is linear regression, and how does it work?
- It is the easiest and one of the most popular Machine Learning algorithms for predictive analysis
- LR, is a statistical method to model the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (inputs).
- Called "linear" because we assume the existence of linear relationship between previous variables.
- It aims to predict continuous/real or numeric variables such as temperature, salary, quantity, price etc. using the remaining features
- It can be classified into two main types : 
    - Simple Linear Regression : to model relationship between an independent variable (x) and a dependent variable (y).
    - Multiple Linear Regression : involves using more than one independent variable (X) to model the relationship with the dependent variable (y).
- It can be used for both continuous and categorical dependent variables (y) and can handle multiple independent variables.
  
### Q3- What are some real-life applications of regression algorithms?
Some examples of real-life applications of regression algorithms are:
- Housing Prices Prediction
- Sales Forecasting: predict future sales using historical sales data and marketing inputs.
- Demand Forecasting
- Financial Forecasting: predict stock prices, exchange rates, and interest rates in finance.
- Risk Assessment: evaluate insurance risks, credit scores, and loan defaults.
- Marketing ROI Analysis: analyze marketing campaign effectiveness for sales prediction.
- Energy Consumption forecasting: forecast electricity usage for energy management.
- Weather Prediction: predict weather patterns, temperature, and precipitation.
- Crop Yield Prediction: estimate crop yields based on weather and soil conditions.
  
## Q4- How Simple Linear Regression works? 
- It is used to model relationship between an independent variable (x) and a dependent variable (y).
- Example: Predicting the price of a house based on its size.
<img src="images/lin_reg.png" width="400">

- The line of regression, is a line of best fit is plotted on a scatter plot of the data points as it is shown in the Figure above
- The equation of this line is : $$y=w \times x + b$$
- Where : 
    - y: dependent/response/target variable, we want to predict it or explain it.
    - x: independent/input/predictor variable(s), it is (they are) used to predict or explain the variability of y
    - w: regression coefficients: the parameters in the regression equation that indicate the strength and direction of the relationship between variables.
    - b:bias term which represents patterns that do not pass through the origin
        
- The line is determined by finding the values of the slope (w) and intercept (b) that minimize the sum of residuals.
- Residuals: 
    - Corresponds to the prediction error which is differences between the observed (y) and predicted values ($\hat y$), .
    - Formula : $e=y-\hat y$
    - We calculate the Sum
- Our main goal is to find the best fit line where the error between predicted values and actual values should be minimized.

### Q5- How Multiple Linear Regression works? 
- The unique difference between Simple and Multiple Linear Regression lies in the number of independent variables used in the regression model.
- We have multiple independent variables $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$
- New equation: $y=b_0+b_1 x_1 + b_2x_2+ ...+b_n x_n$
- Where $b_0$ represents the intercept, and $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$ represent the coefficients of the independent variables.
- Simple linear regression involves one independent variable, while multiple linear regression involves two or more independent variables.
- Example: Predicting the performance of a student based on their age, gender, IQ, etc.
  
### Q6-  What assumptions should you consider before starting a linear regression analysis?
Here are some important assumptions of Linear Regression: 

- Linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables.
- No or little multicolinearity between the features: independent variables are not correlated with each other
- Normal distribution of error terms: residuals (errors), are normally distributed with a mean of zero and a constant variance.
- The residuals are independent of each other, no autocorrelations in error terms
- The model includes all the relevant independent variables needed to accurately predict the dependent variable.
- Homoscedasticity Assumption: it is a situation when the error term is the same for all the values of independent variables. With homoscedasticity, there should be no clear pattern distribution of data in the scatter plot

**Note:**
- Multicollinearity involves high-correlation between the independent variables.
- In this situation, it become difficult to find the true relationship between the predictors and target variables.
- More precisely, it is challenging to point which predictor variable has the major influence on the target variable.

### Q7- What does Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) mean?
- It has foundational role in numerous regression techniques.
- It's a widely adopted method for estimating coefficients or parameters in linear regression models.
- The model formula is : $y = W_0 + W_1 x_1+ W_2 x_2 +...+ W_n x_n + ϵ$, where ϵ represents the error term.
- OLS aims to minimize the sum of squared differences/errors between actual and predicted values, representing the prediction error.
- The choice of summing squared errors, rather than errors directly, is deliberate. This is because errors can cancel each other out when summed directly due to being positive or negative.
- It is widely used as it provides unbiased estimators of the coefficients. 
- It has well-understood statistical properties. 
- It assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables (predictors) $x_i$ and the target $y_i$ 

### Q8- What are the performance metrics for Regression Analysis? 
- Several performance metrics are commonly used to evaluate the accuracy and goodness of fit of regression models.
- Here are some common performance metrics for regression:
    - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
    - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
    - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
    - **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**
    - **R-squared (R2)**
- The choice of metric is related to several goals and characteristics of the regression problem to solve.
- It is possible to use one of the above metrics next to accuracy, precision, and the ability to explain variance.
- Considering multiple metrics is better solution to gain a comprehensive understanding about the model performance.
- Almost, all regression tasks uses error to evaluate the model: if error is high ==> we need either to change the model or retrain it with more data.
  
### Q9- What is Mean Absolute Error (MAE) ? 
- As its name indicates, it represents the average absolute difference between the predicted values and the actual values.
- **Formula :**
$$MAE ={1\over n}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}|y_{i}-\hat{y}_{i}|}$$

### Q10- What is Mean Squared Error (MSE) ?
- It represents the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values.
- It penalizes larger errors more heavily than MAE.
- **Formula:** $$MSE = {1\over n} {\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_{i}-\hat{y}_{i})^2}$$ 

### Q11- What is Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) ? 
- It represents the square root of the MSE
- It provides a measure of the average magnitude of errors in the same units as the target variable.
- **Formula:** $$RMSE= {\sqrt MSE}$$

### Q12- What is Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) ? 
- It calculates the average percentage difference between the predicted and actual values.
- It is a relative error metric
- **Formula:** $$MAPE = {1\over n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} ({|y_{i}- \hat{y}_{i}|\over |y_i|})\times 100$$

### Q13- What is R-squared (R2)
- Known also as the coefficient of determination.
- It corresponds to the degree to which the variance in the dependent variable (the target, y) can be explained by the independent variables (features). 
- Generally, it measures the proportion of variance explained by our regression model model via representing the correlation between true value and predicted value.
- **Formula:** $$R^2= 1 - {MSE \over Var(y) }= 1- {{ \sum_{i=1}^{n} ( y_i - \hat{y}_i )^2 } \over { \sum_i (y- \overline {y})^2 }  }$$
- $\overline{y}$: is the mean of the target variable.
- MSE: Mean Square Error, captures the prediction error of a model
- It is a relative metric where value varies between 0 and 1, the closer is to 1, the better is the fit.
  
Notes: 
- R² does not give any measure of bias, so you can have an overfitted (highly biased) model with a high value of R².
- It is better to look at other metrics to get a good understanding of a model’s performance.
- In the case of non-linear models, it is possible that R² is negative.
- It is possible to use **Adjusted R-squared**, which provides a penalized version of R-squared that adjusts the model complexity.
  
### Q14- Which evaluation metric is more robust to the outliers : MAE or MSE or RMSE ?
- MAE is robust to the outliers as compared to the MSE or RMSE. 
- This is because MAE calculates the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values, which makes it less sensitive to extreme values or outliers. 
- MSE and RMSE involve squaring the differences, which can amplify the impact of outliers on the overall error. 
- Therefore, in datasets with outliers, MAE is often preferred as a more resilient metric for evaluating model performance.
  
##  Decision Trees
### Q15- What does decision tree mean ? 
- It is a non-parametric supervised learning algorithm. 
- It has the tree structure: root node, edges (branches), internal and leaf nodes
- It can be used to solve both Classification and Regression problems.
- We build a tree with datasets broken up into smaller subsets while developing the decision tree
- It can handle both categorical and numerical data 
<img src="images/tree_structure.png" width="400">

*Source: https://www.ibm.com/topics/decision-trees
### Q16- What are the types of decision tree 
- We have three main types :
    - **ID3:** Iterative Dichotomiser 3: splitting datasets is based on metrics like entropy and information gain. 
    - **C4.5:** it is identified as a later iteration of ID3, where it uses information gain or gain ratios to split datasets.
    - **CART:** Classification And Regression Trees: it utilizes Gini impurity to identify the ideal attribute to split the dataset on.

### Q17- What are the different menthods used by DT in splitting datasets? 
Here is the list of methods:

- **Variance:** 
    - Splitting datasets using the variance
    - The variance indicates the spread or dispersion of the data. It measures how much the individual data points, in a dataset, is deviated from the average value. 
    - Prefered when the target variable is continous (Regression)
    - It measures the node impurity via determining the homogeneity of continuous target variables within each node of the tree.
    - High Variance means data points within a node are spread out (heterogeneous), Low Variance means data points within a node are similar and close to the mean.    
    
- **Entropy:** 
    - It is typically used for categorical target variables (Classification).
    - It measures the impurity or disorder in a dataset to evaluate its homogeneity.
    - It determines the best split to build an informative decision tree model.
    - High entropy means that data is heterogeneous (mixed), Low entropy means data is homogeneous and well organized.
    - Formula: $$Entropy =-{\sum p_{i} log_{2}p_{i}}$$
- **Information gain :**
    - It is criteria used to decide whether a feature should be used to split a node or not.
    - Prefered when the target variable is categorical (classification)
    - It corresponds to the mutual information betwee input attribute A and target variable Y.
    - It quantifies the effectiveness of input attribute A in classifying the data by measuring the reduction in entropy or impurity achieved by splitting the data based on that attribute.
    - Formula : $$IG=1- Entropy$$  
- **Gini Impurity :**
    - It is one method to split DT nodes prefered when the target variable is categorical (Classification)
    - Formula : $$Gini Impurity =1−\sum_{i=1}^{c}(p_{i})^2$$
    - Where : $Gini=\sum_{i=1}^{c}(p_{i})^2$, c is the number of classes and $p_{i}$ is the proportion of data points belonging to class i
    - As its name indicates, it measures the impurity of a node
    - Gini is the probability of correctly classifying a randomly chosen data point  if it was randomly labeled according to the distribution of labels in the node. 
    - Gini Impurity is the probability of incorrectly classifying a randomly chosen element if it was randomly labeled based on the distribution of classes in the dataset.
    - Evaluation of Gini Impurity value :
        - If value is low, the homogeneity of the node is high
        - If value is high, the homogeneity of the node is low
        - The Gini Impurity of a pure node is zero
    - Gini Impurity is preferred to information gain because it does not contain logarithms which are computationally intensive an expensive.
- **Chi-Square:**
    - Again, it is one method to split DT nodes prefered when the target variable is categorical (Classification)
    - Formula : $$Chi-Square_{class}=\sqrt{(Actual-Expected_Value)^2 \over Expected_Value}$$
    - Where Expected_Value : the expected value for a class in a child node based on the distribution of classes in the parent node, and the Actual is the actual value for a class in a child node.
    - The Chi-Square for one node has the next formula, c is the number of classes : $$ Chi-Square= \sum_{c}(Chi-Square_{class})$$
    - Evaluation of total Chi-Square value: 
        - If it is high, the differences between parent and child nodes is high ==> high homogeneity.
        - If it is low, the differences between parent and child nodes is low ==> low homogeneity.
                  
### Q18- How many splits are there in a decision tree?
 - As mentioned before, the splitting criteria used by the regression tree and the classification tree are different.
 - For classification problems, if we have n classes in a decision tree, the maximum splits will be $2^{(n -1)} – 1$. 
 - The number of splits in a decision tree for regression depends on several factors:
     - Features number: each feature can be used for splitting at multiple nodes.
     - Maximum tree depth : the deeper is the tree, the more splits we have. However, it can increase the risk of model overfitting.
     - Thresholds: if our feature is continous, we have infinite values that could be used to split node
     - Stopping Criteria: some conditions like minimum samples per leaf or maximum tree depth, can limit the number of splits and prevent the tree from growing excessively.
     
### Q19- What is the best method for splitting a decision tree?
 - Actually, there is no best method that is suitable for all problems but it depends on the problem itself and the target variable we want to estimate (continous or discrete)
 - The most widely used method for splitting a decision tree is the gini index or the entropy.
 - The scikit learn library provides all the splitting methods for classification and regression trees.
   
### Q20- What are the Advantages of Decision Trees?
- Easy to interpret
- Little or no data preparation is needed: handle categorical and continous variables, handle variables with missing values.
- High flexibility : it is used for both classification and regression tasks.

### Q21- What are the disadvantages of Decision Trees ?
- Prone to overfitting : building complex decision tree model can easily overfit because it does not generalize well to unseen data
- High variance estimators :  even little variations within data can produce a very different decision tree
- Too costly: it uses greedy search approach to build decision tree model therefore, training this model can be very expensive to train compared to other algorithms.
  
### Q22- How to avoid Overfitting of a Decision Tree model?
- Overfitting corresponds to the situation when the model captures noise or random fluctuations in the training data which gives poor performance on unseen data. 
- Here a list of methods that could help in avoiding overfitting in DT:
    - Limiting Tree Depth : avoiding having complex trees
    - Pruning : using pre-pruning or post-pruning algorithm.
    - Feature Selection: select the most important features and discard irrelevant and redundant features
    - Cross-Validation: appy cross validation technique such as K-fold cross validation to better tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting
    - Ensemble learning algorthims: such as Random Forests or Gradient Boosting where it leverages combining multiple models to limit overfitting .
    - Minimum Samples per Leaf
    - Minimum Samples per Split    
    
### Q23- What does pruning decision tree mean? 
- Pruning is a technique in ML that aims to reduce the size of DT and remove specific subtrees.
- It aims to reduce the complexity of final model (tree) and improve its generalization performance on real data and unseen. 
- Reduce the complexity means removing or cutting down specific nodes in a decision tree
- Pruning helps improve the predictive accuracy by reducing and prevent overfitting. 
- Two main pruning algorithms : 
    - Pre-pruning : removes subtrees while constructing the model
    - Post-pruning : removes subtrees with inadequate data after tree construction.
      
### Q24- What does Pre-pruning and Post-pruning algorithms mean?
- **Pre-pruning:** 
    - Also, it is called early stopping.
    - It aims to stop the growth of the tree before it becomes fully expanded.
    - We cut or remove a node if it has low importance while growing the tree
    - It occurs in Top-down fashion : it will traverse nodes and train subsets starting at the root
    - Techniques: 
        - Setting maximum tree depth
        - Setting minimum number of samples in leaf nodes
        - Stopping when :
            - There is insufficient data
            - No significant improvements (in impurity or other metrics) are present 

- **Post-pruning:** 
    - Also, it is called backward pruning
    - It involves growing the tree to its maximum size
    - Then, it removes selected branches or subtrees with inadequate data after tree construction or that have no improved performance on validation data.
    - It occurs in Bottom-down fashion : once the tree is built, we start pruning the nodes based on their significance.
    - Techniques:
        - Cost-complexity pruning or reduced error pruning
        - Subtree replacement
          
### Q25- What are the popular pruning algorithms?
Various pruning algorithms are used to reduce the complexity of decision trees and prevent overfitting:
- **Cost complexity pruning**
- **Reduced error pruning**
- **Error-Based Pruning**
- **Subtree Replacement**
- **Minimum Description Length (MDL) Pruning**

- **Cost complexity pruning:**
    - Post-pruning algorithm for Decision Tree
    - It aims to minimising the cost-complexity measure while building the tree.
    - It involves balancing between model simplicity (few nodes) and its performance while building the tree.
    - The pruning process is guided by a cost-complexity parameter, which penalizes complex trees.
    - The decision tree is computed using cross-validation technique to prevent overfitting
    - The decision tree with the smallest cost-complexity measure is choosen as the pruned tree.

- **Reduced error pruning:**
    - It aims to reduce prediction error via removing subtrees which do not improve prediction accuracy on a validation dataset.
    - The tree will be at its maximum size then subtrees which do not significantly decrease the error rate on the validation dataset are selected and removed
    - No conditions regarding tree complexity or a cost-complexity measure are considered.
    - It is all based on the Error reduction.
  
- **Error-Based Pruning:**
    - Includes any pruning technique where pruning subtrees is based on their impact on prediction error.
    - Reduced Error Pruning is a specific example of error-based pruning
    
- **Subtree Replacement:**
    - It consists on replacing a subtree or a branch of the decision tree with a single leaf node.
    - It is an iterative process then, the decision tree's performance is evaluated after each replacement.
    - The model with the best generalization performance is chosen.
    
- **Minimum Description Length (MDL) Pruning**
    - It consists on reducing the complexity of the tree via recursively merging nodes that do not significantly decrease the description length of the tree.
    - Its main target is to find the best model that optimally compresses data via minimizing the combined length of the tree structure and the encoded data.              

### Q26- What are the stopping criteria in splitting datasets in decision trees
- Stopping criteria in decision trees indicate when to stop the process of splitting nodes further and growing the tree :
    - Minimum samples per leaf: minimum number of samples required to be present in a leaf node.
    - Maximum Tree depth: once the model reaches the maximum depth or level of the tree, no further splitting is performed, and all nodes at the maximum depth become leaf nodes.
    - Maximum features: fixing the maximum number of features considered for splitting at each node.
    - Maximum number of nodes: fixing the total number of nodes in the tree.
    - Minimum impurity decrease: it is all based on the comparison between impurity decrease and the minimum decrease in impurity (threshold), no further splitting is performed
      
### Q27- Final comments regarding Decision trees
- Decision trees are very common algorithm in machine learning for solving both classification and regression problems.
- However, creating an optimal decision tree requires finding the right features and splitting the data in an effective way that maximizes information gain.
- Here some useful terms and assumptions regarding decision trees:
    - Binary Splits
    - Feature Independence
    - Homogeneity
    - Can handle both Categorical and Numerical Features
    - Structure :
        - Root Node, Decision Nodes, Leaf Nodes
        - Subtree or branches
        - Parent and Child Node
          
###  Q28- What does Ensemble learning algorithm mean?
- Ensemble involves taking a group of things instead of individual 
- It is a ML algorthim that makes improved decision by combining the predictions from multiple models.
- It leverages the diversity of multiple models to make more robust and accurate predictions.
- It seeks better predictive performance and to increase the accuracy because we could have high variance using a single model.

### Q29- What are the common techniques used by ensemble learning?
- Various techniques are used in Ensemble Learning approach. Here are some common techniques:
    - Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)
    - Boosting
    - Averaging
    - Stacking
    
### Q30- What does Bagging Ensemble Learning mean? 
- It is an ensemble learning technique. 
- It is known as Bootstrap Aggregating
- It aims to improve the stability, avoid overfiting and increase accuracy of machine learning models 
- It is based on training multiple instances of the same model on different subsets of the training data and combining their predictions.
- It helps deacrease the variance of the individual models and increase prediction accuracy within noisy dataset 
- It is highly parallelizable since each base model can be trained independently on a separate bootstrap sample
- Bagging is widely used in various machine learning applications, including classification, regression, and anomaly detection, to improve predictive performance and generalization ability.
- Bagging can be used for :
  - Classification 
  - Regression
   
### Q31- How Bagging algorithm works?
- Bagging starts by creating multiple bootstrap samples (Bootstrapping) from the original training data.
- The extracted subsets with replacement have the same size as the original datasets.
- Some data points may be repeated in each bootstrap sample, while others may be left out because bootstrap sampling involves random selection with replacement.
- Then, a machine learning algorithm is applied to each of these subsets. 
- After training each single model, bagging combines predictions from all models using an aggregation method.
- The aggregation method changes based on the task and the problem: 
    - For classification tasks, the most common aggregation method is to use a majority voting scheme.
    - For regression tasks, the predictions of base models are typically averaged to obtain the final prediction. This means adding up the predictions from all the models and dividing by the total number of models to get the average prediction.

    - min_samples_split: Specifies the minimum number of samples required for a node to split.
    - max_leaf_nodes: Controls node splitting and helps restrict the model's depth.
    
### Q36- What does Boosting Ensemble Learning mean?
- It is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple weak learners to create a strong learner.
- Boosting trains weak learners sequentially.
- Each new learner corrects the mistakes of the previous ones, enhancing the ensemble's performance over time.
- weak learner means a simple model

- Each boosting algorithm has its own variations and enhancements

### Q37- How Boosting techniques works in Regression?
- Iteratively training a series of weak regression models to predict continuous target values.
- Each subsequent model aims to  reduce the errors made by the previous ones.
- The algorithm assigns higher weights to the instances where the previous models had larger errors, effectively boosting their importance in subsequent iterations.
- This iterative process continues until a strong regression model, which combines the predictions of all weak models, is obtained.
- Generally, it aims to enhance the accuracy and predictive power of the final regression model.

### Q38- How Gradient Boosting works?
- It builds an ensemble of decision trees, where each tree is trained to correct the errors of the previous ones by minimizing a loss function.
- Loss function measures the difference between predicted and actual values such as MSE
- It uses a gradient descent algorithm to optimization (minimise) the loss fucntion.
- Here is more details how it works :
   - The first weak learner in the gradient boosting algorithm will not be trained on the dataset.
   - It will predict the average of the relevant column.
   - Then, subsequent learners focus on minimizing the errors (residuals) made by the previous ones.
   - Each learner is trained to predict the residuals of the ensemble so far.
   - This process continues until the residuals become almost zero.
 
### Q39- Advantages Vs disadvantages of Gradient Boosting

### Q40- How AdaBoost works?
- Short for Adaptive Boosting
- Here how it works: 
   - Initially, all data points  is assigned an equal weight.
   - After training the first weak learner (usually decision tree), AdaBoost increases the importance of larger errors (regression) points.
   - This makes them more influential in training subsequent weak learners, which focus more on correcting these mistakes.
   - This iterative process continues until a perfect model is achieved.
   - In the end, AdaBoost combines the predictions of all weak learners using weighted averaging to make the final prediction.

### Q51- What does Stacking Ensemble Learning mean?
- It is known as stacked generalization or stacked ensemble. 
- It is a technique where multiple diverse base models are trained independently.
- Then, their predictions are used as input features for a meta-model, which combines these predictions to make the final prediction.
- The process of stacking ensemble learning has the next steps:
 - Base Models: A set of diverse base models (e.g., decision trees, support vector machines, neural networks) are trained on the training data.
 - Predictions: Each base model makes predictions on the validation set or a holdout set of the training data.
 - Meta-Model: The predictions from the base models are used as input features for a meta-model (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting). The meta-model is trained on the validation set, where the true target values are known.
 - Final Prediction: Once the meta-model is trained, it can make predictions on unseen data by using the predictions of the base models as input features. The final prediction is typically the output of the meta-model.
- It is a powerful technique for building robust and accurate machine learning models.
