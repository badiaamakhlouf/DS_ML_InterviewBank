    "### Q12- What does Padding technique mean in CNNs?\n",
    "- Padding is a technique used in CNNs for several reasons:\n",
    "  - **Preserve spatial information:** \n",
    "      - Of the input data as it passes through convolutional layers.\n",
    "      - It is important when the spatial relationships between features are essential for the task at hand.\n",
    "      \n",
    "  - **Avoiding edge effects:**\n",
    "      - Padding prevents information loss at the edges by allowing filters to be applied to all areas of the input. \n",
    "      - It maintain spatial resolution and preventing edge effects.\n",
    "      \n",
    "  - **Controlling Output Size:**\n",
    "      - Padding allows for greater control over the spatial dimensions of the output feature maps.\n",
    "      - By adjusting padding, you can control the output feature map size and customize the CNN architecture to fit the task.\n",
    "      \n",
    "  - **Stabilize training:** \n",
    "      - Ensure that the gradients propagated during backpropagation are consistent across all regions of the input.         - This can prevent issues such as vanishing gradients or exploding gradients, especially in deeper networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:**\n",
    "- Edge effects: the spatial dimensions (length, width, and height) of the output feature maps are smaller than those of the input, leading to a reduction in spatial resolution and potential loss of information at the edges of the input.\n",

    "### Q13- List common Padding techniques in CNNs?\n",
    "- **Valid Padding:**\n",
    "   - Known as \"no padding\" in which no padding is added to the input. \n",
    "   - As a result, the spatial dimensions of the output feature map are reduced after convolution, as only complete filter windows are applied to the input.\n",
    "- **Same Padding:**\n",
    "   - Padding is added to the input so that the spatial dimensions of the output feature map are the same as those of the input.\n",
    "   - It is achieved by adding zeros around the input such that the filter can be applied to every spatial location.\n",
    "- **Full Padding:**\n",
    "   - It pads the input with enough zeros so that the spatial dimensions of the output feature map are increased after convolution.\n",
    "   - This means that the filter can be applied to every possible position within the input, resulting in an output feature map with larger spatial dimensions."
